# Attribution tutorial (Binder-ready)

This folder is a self-contained, beginner-friendly Jupyter/R tutorial that can run entirely in a web browser via Binder.

Binder is a free service that launches a temporary Jupyter environment from a GitHub repo.

## Getting started (browser-only)

1. Click the Binder badge above to launch the notebook.
2. Wait for JupyterLab to open.
3. In the file browser, open `rwwa-mwe_01_attribution.ipynb`.
4. Click the first code cell, then press Shift+Enter to run cells one by one.

## Reset

If you need a completely clean start, do the following:
1. In JupyterLab, click File -> New -> Terminal.
2. In the terminal, run: `./reset_notebook.sh`.
3. Re-open `rwwa-mwe_01_attribution.ipynb`.
